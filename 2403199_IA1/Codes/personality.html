                <h2>Kevin's Personality</h2>
                    <p>I’m a laid-back yet strong-willed university student who embraces minimalism in my life. I like to keep things simple and focus on meeting the requirements without going overboard. This minimalist mindset definitely influences my academics; I often find myself doing just enough to get by instead of pushing myself to truly excel. I tend to prioritize efficiency over depth, which sometimes means I miss out on fully exploring my potential.

                        Sports, especially football, are a huge part of my life—I love both playing and watching them. Because of this passion, I often prioritize sports over my studies, which can lead to me doing the bare minimum in my coursework, even though I know I’m capable of so much more. I find it hard to dive into studying unless I see it as absolutely essential, which can be a real challenge. Balancing my love for sports with my academic responsibilities is an ongoing journey, and I’m working on finding that sweet spot where I can enjoy both without compromising my potential. </p>

                    <p>Choosing Doflamingo as a hero might seem a bit unconventional, but I think it’s really interesting. Doflamingo, also known as Donquixote Doflamingo, is a major antagonist in the anime and manga series "One Piece." He’s a former Warlord of the Sea and the captain of the Donquixote Pirates, known for his ruthless nature and powerful abilities, including the ability to manipulate strings.
                    What makes him stand out is his complex character and deep backstory. Despite all the terrible things he does, you can see how his tragic past shaped him, which makes him relatable in some ways. His charisma and intelligence are super captivating, and I find it fascinating how he challenges the typical ideas of good and evil. Doflamingo really makes you think about morality in a different way, and I love exploring those gray areas in storytelling.</p>

                <p>ISTP- Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving.</p>
                <p>I think the ISTP personality type is pretty valid in describing who I am. It really helps me understand my own behaviors and preferences, which is super useful for self-reflection. For instance, as an ISTP, I tend to be practical and adaptable, which makes sense because I often prefer hands-on problem-solving. This insight not only helps me navigate my own life better but also improves my interactions with others. Knowing that people have different personality types allows me to appreciate their perspectives, even if they differ from mine.</p>
